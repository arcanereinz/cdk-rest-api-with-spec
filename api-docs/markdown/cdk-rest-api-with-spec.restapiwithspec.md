## RestApiWithSpec class

> This API is provided as a preview for developers and may change based on feedback that we receive. Do not use this API in a production environment.
> 

CDK construct that provisions an API Gateway REST API endpoint and also synthesizes the OpenAPI definition for it.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare class RestApiWithSpec 
```

## Remarks

NOTE: Please turn on the validation of CDK stacks. If you skip the validation of CDK stacks, this construct cannot synthesize the OpenAPI definition. Because this construct utilizes the validation as a trigger to start synthesis.

The constructor is private. Use [RestApiWithSpec.createRestApi()](./cdk-rest-api-with-spec.restapiwithspec.createrestapi.md) instead.
